            <h2 class="hero-subtitle">Six Uncomfortable Truths</h2>
            <p class="hero-description">
                Despite rising incomes, expanding grid connections, and abundant natural resources, most Africans still consume extremely little electricity. This project investigates why electricity deprivation persists across Sub-Saharan Africa, moving beyond access statistics to examine consumption inequality, affordability barriers, grid reliability failures, and long-term divergence patterns. It's deliberately diagnostic rather than prescriptive—challenging intuitions and identifying where the problem truly lies.

Enterprise Survey data covers formal registered firms only—misses informal sector and household generators (likely substantial). Survey samples typically 300-1,500 firms per country, not nationally representative. Survey years vary (2015-2023), creating temporal misalignment with 2022-2023 grid data. Generator capacity assumption (50 kW) is rough average—actual range 10-500 kW depending on firm size. Utilization hours (6/day) based on outage duration but actual runtime may differ. "Firms" count from Doing Business database includes wide definition (all registered businesses). Cross-validation attempted using diesel import statistics but challenging to separate generator fuel from transport/other uses. Estimates are deliberately conservative—likely understate true parallel generation. Some countries lack recent Enterprise Survey data (e.g., DRC 2013, Angola 2010), requiring use of dated generator ownership rates.

                    Sub-Saharan Africa possesses world-class renewable resources: 5-6 kWh/m²/day solar irradiance (world's highest), strong wind corridors in East and Southern Africa, and 1,000+ GW untapped hydro potential. Yet total renewable deployment across SSA is less than 50 GW for 1.2 billion people (40W/capita) versus Germany's 140 GW for 84 million (1,670W/capita). Nigeria has solar potential matching Saudi Arabia but less than 0.2 GW deployed. DRC has Africa's largest hydro potential (100 GW) but only 2.5 GW installed. The crisis isn't resource scarcity—it's investment barriers, policy uncertainty, and institutional failure.

Capacity factor differences not shown: 1 MW hydro ≠ 1 MW solar in actual generation. POTENTIAL DATA - Solar potential estimates vary by source (Global Solar Atlas vs NREL) based on different efficiency assumptions and exclusion criteria (protected areas, slopes, urban areas). We used conservative estimates. Wind potential highly variable by location—national averages mask regional concentrations. Hydro potential includes large projects that may be environmentally/socially controversial (e.g., Grand Inga in DRC). "Potential" doesn't account for economic viability, transmission infrastructure needs, or seasonal variability. Some countries (small island states, landlocked Sahel) have limited diverse renewable portfolio.

                    Kenya doubled consumption 150→350 kWh through integrated grid and off-grid programs. Rwanda tripled 50→145 kWh despite starting from genocide. Ethiopia grew through massive hydro investment. Meanwhile, Nigeria stagnated 145→160 kWh despite 4× Kenya's GDP per capita and oil revenues. Angola and DRC show similar patterns: GDP growth without electricity investment equals hollow development. The gap between Escapers and Trapped widened 2010-2023, not closed. Policy determines trajectories: grid + off-grid integration (Kenya), renewable investment (Ethiopia), and governance stability (Rwanda) enable escape.

                    <p>[PLACEHOLDER: TEMPORAL COVERAGE - Not all countries have complete 2010-2023 series. Countries with >3 consecutive missing years excluded from trajectory analysis. South Sudan (independent 2011) only included from 2012 forward. LINEAR INTERPOLATION used for single-year gaps where data exists before/after. ELASTICITY CALCULATION sensitive to base year effects—countries starting from very low consumption may show high elasticity from small absolute gains. We used compound annual growth rate (CAGR) approach to smooth volatility. GDP in PPP terms reduces currency fluctuation effects but PPP conversion factors themselves updated periodically by World Bank, creating slight discontinuities. CONSUMPTION DATA doesn't distinguish GDP composition—oil-exporting economies may show high GDP with low residential consumption. Trajectory lines can obscure individual years—slider interaction addresses this. Some dramatic changes (e.g., civil conflicts, droughts affecting hydro) create outlier years that distort smooth trends. CLASSIFICATION THRESHOLDS (0.5, 0.25) chosen based on development economics literature suggesting 1:1 elasticity desirable for inclusive growth, but thresholds somewhat arbitrary. Countries near boundaries (0.24 vs 0.26) may be misclassified. Small population countries (e.g., Seychelles, Cabo Verde) show high volatility year-to-year, excluded or flagged as anomalies.]</p>

Missing data handled through: (a) forward-filling for slowly-changing variables like tariffs, (b) linear interpolation for consumption trends where single-year gaps exist, (c) exclusion where gaps exceeded 3 consecutive years.

                    Key methodological decisions: (1) <strong>Consumption per capita preferred over total generation</strong> because it accounts for population size and reveals inequality invisible in aggregate figures. (2) <strong>Generator ownership as reliability proxy</strong>—Enterprise Survey data on backup generators provides standardized measure of grid failure across countries. (3) <strong>Logarithmic scaling for GDP</strong> in Charts 3 and 6 addresses right-skewed income distribution and emphasizes proportional relationships. (4) <strong>Regression analysis</strong> uses OLS with robust standard errors; Chart 3 includes 95% confidence intervals. (5) <strong>Temporal classification</strong> in Chart 6 based on electricity-GDP elasticity thresholds from development literature.

                                Consumption inequality dwarfs connection inequality. South Africa's 4,000 kWh/capita versus Chad's 132 kWh/capita represents a 30× gap invisible in access rates. Policy should target minimum consumption thresholds (500 kWh/capita for basic productive use) not just connection counts. Otherwise we celebrate 100% connections while populations remain energy-poor.

                        International development frameworks (SDG7, African Development Bank's New Deal on Energy for Africa) should incorporate consumption, affordability, and reliability metrics alongside access targets. Proposed additions:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="policy-list">
                        <li><strong>Consumption targets:</strong> Minimum 500 kWh/capita for productive use (refrigeration, small business equipment)</li>
                        <li><strong>Affordability metrics:</strong> Tariff as % of median daily income, hours worked per 100 kWh</li>
                        <li><strong>Reliability indicators:</strong> Average outage frequency/duration, % firms owning backup generators</li>
                        <li><strong>Progress tracking:</strong> Annual electricity-GDP elasticity, divergence indices between countries</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Need differentiated strategies: grid extension where viable (urban/peri-urban), off-grid solutions where cost-effective (rural, dispersed), but always with focus on sufficiency not just access. Kenya's integrated approach—grid expansion plus off-grid solar acceleration—demonstrates this is possible.
