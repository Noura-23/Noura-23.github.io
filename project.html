        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project challenges conventional narratives about electricity access in Sub-Saharan Africa by examining
            how structural choices, institutional capacity, and resource allocation strategies create diverging energy
            trajectories across the continent. Rather than treating SSA as a monolithic region, this analysis reveals
            three distinct "Energy Africas" emerging from fundamentally different approaches to power system development.
        </p>
        <p>
            The analysis moves beyond simple access metrics to explore the hidden dimensions of energy systems,
            including the parallel diesel-powered economy, the relationship between institutional capacity and
            investment flows, and the critical question of whether renewable energy is actually closing the electricity
            gap or simply creating new forms of energy inequality.

                    sort across different dimensions of energy performance. The visualization demonstrates that these
                    categories represent fundamentally different energy systems, not just different stages of the same
