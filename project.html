        </div>
        <h1 class="research-question">
            If income and electrification have increased across Africa,
            why do Africans still consume so little electricity?
        </h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Project aim:</strong> This project dismantles comforting narratives about progress.
            High access rates mask profound consumption inequality. Grid connections don't guarantee
            usable electricity when systems are unaffordable, unreliable, or constrained by policy failures.
            Each visualization answers a necessary sub-question, building from symptoms to mechanisms
            to structural explanations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Six visualizations reveal the truth: Africa's electricity crisis is not a lack of connections,
            income, or resources. It is a failure of systems—how electricity is priced, governed, and delivered.

        <h2>The Divide</h2>
        <p class="question">Does electricity access reflect real electricity use?</p>
        <p>
            While access rates suggest substantial progress across Africa, electricity consumption remains extremely low
            and uneven.
            Many countries with widespread grid connections still consume too little power to support basic modern
            living standards.

        <div class="transitions">
            <p>
                This gap between connection and use raises a deeper question: how much electricity do Africans actually
                consume?

        <h2>Living on 3 Lightbulbs</h2>
        <p class="question">How much electricity do Africans actually use?</p>
        <p>
            Most countries fall far below the World Bank's 1,000 kWh threshold for basic modern energy use,
            indicating that electricity use is largely limited to lighting and minimal household needs rather than
            refrigeration,
            heating, or productive appliances.

        <div class="transitions">
            <p>
                If consumption is this low even where access exists, the explanation cannot be access alone.
                Why, then, do people consume so little electricity?

        <h2>The Injustice</h2>
        <p class="question">Is low electricity use simply a result of poverty?</p>
        <p>
            Rather than falling with income, electricity prices are often highest in the poorest countries.
            High tariffs make electricity unaffordable for households and firms, sharply constraining demand
            even when grid connections exist.
        </p>
        <div id="vis3"></div>
        <div class="transitions">
            <p>
                But high prices are only part of the story.
                What happens when electricity is not only expensive—but unreliable?

        <h2>The Hidden Economy</h2>
        <p class="question">How do households and firms cope when the grid doesn't deliver?
        </p>
        <p>
            In many countries, firms produce a large share of their own electricity using costly backup generators.
            This invisible parallel system raises production costs, increases emissions, and weakens trust in the
            formal grid—further suppressing demand for grid electricity.

        <div class="transitions">
            <p>
                If people and firms are exiting the grid, the problem may not be demand at all.
                Does Africa simply lack the energy resources to power its economies?

        <h2>The Paradox</h2>
        <p class="question">Does Africa lack energy resources—or the systems to use them?</p>
        <p>
            Despite some of the world's highest solar, hydro, and wind resources, deployed capacity remains extremely
            limited.
            The disconnect between potential and deployment suggests that Africa's electricity crisis is not driven by
            natural
            scarcity, but by failures in infrastructure, investment, and systems.

            Modified Chart 5 Title:
            "The Paradox: Solar Abundance Doesn't Predict Deployment"
            Correlation analysis reveals that solar resource quality shows minimal correlation with installed capacity,
            while GDP and institutional factors show strong positive correlations—evidence that Africa's electricity
            crisis stems from system failures, not natural scarcity.

        <h2>The Divergence</h2>
        <p class="question">Do electricity outcomes improve automatically as countries grow richer?</p>
        <p>
            Some countries steadily expand electricity use as incomes rise, while others stagnate despite economic
            growth.
            Rather than converging, electricity outcomes diverge—indicating that time and growth alone do not resolve
            the problem.

        <p>
            Africa's electricity challenge is not about lacking connections, income, or resources. It is about
            how electricity systems are priced, governed, and delivered. Six uncomfortable truths reveal the gap
            between perception and reality:

                        Consumption inequality dwarfs connection inequality. South Africa's 4,000 kWh/capita versus
                        Chad's 132 kWh/capita represents a 30× gap invisible in access rates. Policy should target
                        minimum consumption thresholds (500 kWh/capita for basic productive use) not just connection
                        counts.

                        Nigeria's renewable underinvestment despite 5.5 kWh/m²/day solar irradiance reflects policy
                        failure,
                        not technical constraint. Chart 6's temporal dimension shows gaps widened 2010-2023, not
                        converged—some
                        countries escaped (Kenya, Rwanda, Ethiopia) through policy reform, others stagnated (Nigeria,
                        DRC, Angola)

            <p>
                Key methodological decisions: (1) <strong>Consumption per capita preferred over total
                    generation</strong>
                because it accounts for population size and reveals inequality invisible in aggregate figures.
                (2) <strong>Generator ownership as reliability proxy</strong>—Enterprise Survey data on backup
                generators
                provides standardized measure of grid failure across countries. (3) <strong>Logarithmic scaling for
                    GDP</strong>
                addresses right-skewed income distribution. (4) <strong>Regression analysis</strong> uses OLS with
                robust
                standard errors. (5) <strong>Temporal classification</strong> based on electricity-GDP elasticity
                thresholds
                from development literature.
