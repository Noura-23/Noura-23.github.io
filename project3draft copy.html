            <h2>Six Uncomfortable Truths</h2>
            <!--
            <p>
                Despite rising incomes, expanding grid connections, and abundant natural resources, 
                most Africans still consume extremely little to no electricity. This project investigates 
                why electricity deprivation persists across Africa, moving beyond access statistics to 
                examine consumption inequality, affordability barriers, grid reliability failures, 
                and long-term divergence patterns.

            If income and electrification have increased across Africa,
            why do Africans still consume so little electricity?
        </h1>

        <!-- Project Aim -->
        <p>
            <strong>Project aim:</strong> This project dismantles comforting narratives about progress.
            High access rates mask profound consumption inequality. Grid connections don't guarantee
            usable electricity when systems are unaffordable, unreliable, or constrained by policy failures.
            Each visualization answers a necessary sub-question, building from symptoms to mechanisms
            to structural explanations.
        </p>

        <!-- Key Takeaway -->
        <p>
            Six visualizations reveal the truth: Africa's electricity crisis is not a lack of connections,
            income, or resources. It is a failure of systems—how electricity is priced, governed, and delivered.

        <p class="question">Does electricity access reflect real electricity use?</p>
        <p>
            While access rates suggest substantial progress across Africa, electricity consumption remains extremely low
            and uneven.
            Many countries with widespread grid connections still consume too little power to support basic modern
            living standards.

                is profound. Southern Africa clusters at 3,000-4,000 kWh/capita while West Africa remains below

            <p>
                This project relies entirely on publicly accessible, open data from international organizations
                and research institutions. Primary sources include: <strong>World Bank World Development
                    Indicators</strong>
                (electricity access, consumption, GDP, population 2010-2023), <strong>International Energy Agency
                    Statistics</strong> (tariffs, generation mix), <strong>IRENA Renewable Capacity Statistics
                    2024</strong>
                (solar, wind, hydro installed capacity), <strong>World Bank Enterprise Surveys</strong> (generator
                ownership rates 2015-2023), <strong>Global Solar Atlas</strong> and <strong>Global Wind Atlas</strong>
                (renewable resource potential).

                All visualizations built in <strong>Vega-Lite 5.x</strong>, embedded in HTML via
                <strong>vegaEmbed</strong>.
                Data processing workflow implemented in <strong>Python</strong> (pandas for data manipulation,
                statsmodels for regression analysis). Complete data processing pipeline documented in public

            <h3>Analytical Approach</h3>
            <p>
                Key methodological decisions: (1) <strong>Consumption per capita preferred over total
                    generation</strong>
                because it accounts for population size and reveals inequality invisible in aggregate figures.
                (2) <strong>Generator ownership as reliability proxy</strong>—Enterprise Survey data on backup
                generators
                provides standardized measure of grid failure across countries. (3) <strong>Logarithmic scaling for
                    GDP</strong>
                addresses right-skewed income distribution. (4) <strong>Regression analysis</strong> uses OLS with
                robust
                standard errors. (5) <strong>Temporal classification</strong> based on electricity-GDP elasticity
                thresholds
                from development literature.
